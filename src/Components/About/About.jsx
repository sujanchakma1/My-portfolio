          Hi! I'm <strong>Sujan Chakma</strong>, a 
          <strong> Front-End Developer | MERN Stack Enthusiast.</strong>
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Web development has been a long-time dream of mine. For a while, I
          couldn't start due to a lack of proper guidance and resources. But
          everything changed when I discovered the{" "}
          <strong>Programming Hero Web Development Bootcamp</strong>. That was a turning point — I joined the course and finally stepped into the world I always wanted to be in.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Since then, I’ve been learning and building with technologies like
          <strong> HTML, CSS, Tailwind, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express,</strong> and
          <strong> MongoDB</strong>. I enjoy creating user-friendly interfaces and meaningful full-stack applications.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
          Outside of coding, I love playing football, listening to music, time spends with friends and exploring new tech tools. I'm passionate about learning, teamwork, and growing as a developer in the IT industry.
