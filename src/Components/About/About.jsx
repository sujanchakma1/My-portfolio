          Hi! I'm Sujan — a web development enthusiast currently learning and
          building projects with modern technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
          React.js, Node.js, and MongoDB. I am focused on front-end development
          and also exploring full-stack capabilities using the MERN stack. I’ve
          already built several projects like responsive websites, CRUD apps,
          Firebase authentication systems, and RESTful APIs. I enjoy solving
          real-world problems through code, and I believe in clean design and
          optimized performance. Even though I’m currently learning and growing
          in this field, I’m confident in my ability to deliver quality work
          with full dedication and communication. Let’s collaborate and bring
          your ideas to life!
