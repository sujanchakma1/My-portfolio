          At <strong>Chittagong Polytechnic Institute (CPI)</strong>, I have gained strong foundational knowledge in both
          theoretical and practical aspects of computing â€” including web
          development, data structures, programming, and database systems. My
          learning environment is highly project-based, which has helped me
          develop real-world skills and problem-solving abilities.
